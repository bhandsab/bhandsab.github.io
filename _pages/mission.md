Our mission is to put an affordable and accessible health service in the hands of every person on earth. This may sound too ambitious, so below we share how we think the current global health delivery system can be radically reworked to democratise healthcare for everyone and everywhere. We share with you our experience of having served some of the richest and poorest in the world, and our plans to serve many more countries. Our work so far has only been possible because of the trust that our early members put in us to show what can be done. Together, we will make healthcare accessible and affordable, and put it in the hands of everyone on earth.
